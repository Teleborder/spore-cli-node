first to register app == owner

anyone (with an account on the pod) can create cells

owner can grant read permissions to environments to other users
if they don't have an account, send an email
email should link to auto-generated install script with invite code

for invites to existing users maybe email, but no action required

can't list apps

can list users who have read access on app/env

- maybe open source the server too - try to drive adoption
- call the server spore-pod
  - hosted version free for up to 5 users
  - $50/month for a team of up to 10
  - $200/month for a team of up to 20
  - $10/user/month after that?
- is it still valuable without the central server?


- have a version of `run` that doesn't save to a cache (for production/staging)

have settings in the central cache
- netrc file to use

have a special api key for each environment that only maps to that environment (i.e. you don't need to specify the environment)

migrate
- heroku (set spore key on heroku server)
  - how to distinguish production and staging?
- dotenv

install script
- curl install.spore.sh | sh
  - should make sure npm is installed: `curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh`
